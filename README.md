# HYF - Practice repo

> This is practice repo for my class mates cohort 46

## Practice Assignment

0. fork the repo to your github
1. clone the repo to local.
2. make a branch with your name
3. change one word or sentence from old document
4. write a new sentence at the end.
5. commit the changes.
6. merge your the branch to master branch.
7. push to origin.
8. create a pull request.

> In my opinion 🧠 : If you can do that you are ready for git and github. If you stuck along the way don't worry. Search google/ask question.

### Tips:

git clone https://github.com/Tenzijn/HYF-Demo.git
